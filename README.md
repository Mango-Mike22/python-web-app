# python-web-app
A tkinter built program that is able to pull data from a website and plot it into a graph
The code it self was taken from a tutorial done by sentdex. I changed a few lines of code because it would not run correctly based on his exact tutorial.
The comments through out the program are designed to not only comment on the program itself but to comment on the concepts behind what goes on in there
